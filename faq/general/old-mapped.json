The RP and BP that are passed to regolith as an input are copied to different location and than modified. The filter is basically any program/script which does something with resource pack or behavior pack.\n\nRegolith is a tool which hopefully will help people standarize the scripts that they use to speed up their workflows. Minecraft addon system is far from perfect and its often necessery to generate a lot of code. Regolith may help with making these code generators easier to reuse. Use of regolith isn't limited only to generating code. Some of the filters could be used for different task like printing some stats of the project, uploading some files to the internet or looking for errors.\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith\nWebsite:\nhttps://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/"

The first thing you should adjust is the, priority and the probability. \n\nThe next thing to realize is that Minecraft has hard-coded concept of `body` and `head` bones (groups). The `head` bone is hard-coded to react FIRST, then the rest of the bones follow. \n\nIf your entity has a head (like a dog), make sure to name the geometry correctly so that Minecraft can use this information. If your entity does NOT have a head (like a signboard, or a hologram), you should decide whether you want the entity to react FAST (name the top-bone `head`), or slow (name it `body`, or anything else).\n\nBeing aware of the bone names of `body` and `head` is one way you can make `look_at_player` react better.\n\nStill not happy? Get over it. Its just sometimes glitchy or slow. The component is designed to naturally make entities look at the player. Its not designed to instantly snap to their location. Even in a best-case scenario  you will need to deal with the hard-coded interpolation."
